# Threat Event (Impossible Travel)
**Anomalous Login Locations**

## Steps Taken by "Bad Actor":
1. **Initial Login:**
   - Login to "Victim" computer from a VM using "compromised" credentials.
   - Run CMD and run "ipconfig" to generate logs.
2. **Simulated Travel:**
   - Use a VPN or proxy to switch to a different geographic location (e.g., Argentina).
   - Perform another login on the same "victim" computer.
   - Run CMD and run "ipconfig" to generate logs.
3. **Post-Attack Behavior:**
   - Logout after completing "suspicious" activity.
